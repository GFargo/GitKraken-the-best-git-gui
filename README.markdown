## Presentation Technology

This presentation was originally forked from the [Spectacle Boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate) and the core Spectacle API is available at [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

### Development

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `npm install`

Next, run `rm -R .git` to remove the existing version control.

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

### Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`
