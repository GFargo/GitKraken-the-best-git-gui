# GitKraken: The Best Git GUI Yet

## What is GitKraken

GitKraken is a cross platform Git graphical user interface written in Node.  It supports Windows, OSX, and Linux 
*( Availabe on Ubuntu LTS 12.04+, Fedora 21+, and Debian 8+ )*.

Unlike [other](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) [competitors](https://www.git-tower.com/) with similar feature suites and refinement, **GitKraken is 100% free**.


## Workflow Improvments

Check out the [features list](https://www.gitkraken.com/features) on the GitKraken website for an overview of all the current features.

### Better Commits

Forget about `git add .` and start staging individual lines or entire chunks within a single file to create logical commits instead of staging the entire file.

### Longer Commit Messages

GitKraken makes it easy to add detailed comments on each commit, instead of just a single commit message. 

### Fuzzy Search

GitKraken features a powerful [fuzzy search](https://blog.axosoft.com/2016/04/28/gitkraken-fuzzy-finder/) tool that allows users to quickly preform various actions like switching repositories, looking at history for a specific file or checking out a new branch.

### Merge How You Want

#### Drag and Drop

### Flexible UI

Because GitKraken is built upon web technologies it excels at adapting to different dimenions.  You can even scale down the interface if you are working on a smaller laptop screen to free up additional screen realestate.

#### Focus on what's important

GitKraken allows you to *solo* individual branches and focus on the commits specific to the branch you are working with.

#### Simplify Commit Tree

### Built in Merge Tool

In May, GitKraken released a built in [merge tool](https://blog.axosoft.com/2016/05/03/merge-conflict-tool/).  If you prefer another application to resolve conflicts, no problem, GitKraken supports 3rd-party merge tools as well - but for those users who haven't previously installed a merge tool; GitKraken provides a clear path to resolve conflicts inside the app.

### #ItWasNeverADress

Axosoft actively supports the #ItWasNeverADress invitation with the goal to "...shift perceptions and assumptions about women and the audacious, sensitive, and powerful gestures they make every single day. In science, technology, arts, mathematics, politics, houses of worship, on the streets, and in our homes, insightful women are often uninvited, overlooked, or just plain dismissed. Through storytelling, community building, innovation and creative disruptions, #ItWasNeverADress will foster necessary conversations, vital voices, and images from around the world that honor ALL women. When we see women differentlyâ€¦ we see the world differently!" - [source](https://itwasneveradress.com/about/)







## Presentation Technology

This presentation was originally forked from the [Spectacle Boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate) and the core Spectacle API is available at [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

### Development

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `npm install`

Next, run `rm -R .git` to remove the existing version control.

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll

### Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`
